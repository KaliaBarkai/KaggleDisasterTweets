# Kaggle Disaster Tweets Model Interpretability
This GitHub repository includes a logistic regression implementation on the Kaggle Disaster Tweets challenge with a focus on model interpretability tools such as LIME and SHAP.

The Disaster Tweets challenge is a natural language processing (NLP) data science problem where the model aims to predict whether or not a Tweet is referring to a real disaster based on the Tweet text body, the keywords of the Tweet and the location it was sent from.

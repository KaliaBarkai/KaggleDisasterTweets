# Model
In this folder you can find the Python notebook for the Disaster Tweets model. The model includes data pre-processing, a logistic regression model and LIME and SHAP model interpretability implementations.

Due to some of the images not rendering on GitHub, all visualisations produced from LIME and SHAP can be found in the Images folder.
